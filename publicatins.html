        <p style="font-size: 30px;">Europe-Central Asia Relations-New Connectivity Frameworks ( Palgrave)
            This book addresses the current state of economic and political development within Central Asia and the
            importance of European countries and organizations as international actors and supranational organizations
            for the Central Asian Region. It also presents a critical analysis of how the strategy towards the region
            has been limited when compared with China when the relationship has become more robust after China’s Belt
            and Road Initiative (BRI).
        </p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">By analyzing the development of Europe-Central Asia relations, with a particular
            focus on the period of
            2007-2019 and the European Union's (EU) 2019 Strategy. This book reflects its possible impact and
            differences from previous strategies and policies. In addition, this book also reflects on the current
            regional development of the Central Asia Economic Union and hence the influence of China’s BRI as a foreign
            play linking Central Asia and Europe beyond the EU’s ’s and Central Asia’s direct political influence.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 30px;">Europe-Central Asia Relations: New Connectivity Frameworks offers alternative views.
            It tackles questions of
            whether and to what extent the EU and Europe do not have enough leverage, as well as willingness to develop
            sufficient linkages to further integrate Central Asia as a counterbalance to Russia and China. Over the past
            year’s Europe’s economic alliance in the region, and the launch of the Global Gateway initiative in 2021 has
            been seen as an answer to BRI to counterbalance Chinas approach in the region. But Central Asian countries
            use their resources and very strategic locations vis-à-vis major powers in Europe, Russia and China.
